### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Optional
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- If you don't have nodemon installed you can change the start script in the `package.json` to `"node server/server.js"`

## Installation

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open your editor and run `npm install` in your terminal - this will install required dependencies.
2. run `npm run server` in your terminal. (Default port is 5000, if port is in use modify `server.js` port variable.)
3. run `npm run client` in a new terminal - this will launch the app in the browser.

## Usage

1. As a user I want to be able to view gallery images
2. As a user I want to be able to view item descriptions
3. As a user I want to be able to like an item
4. As a user I want to be able to view how many likes an item has
5. As a user I want to be able to add an item to the gallery
6. As a user I want to be able to delete an item from the gallery
